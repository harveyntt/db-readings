# readme

This repo contains Python ports of the code listings from [Clever Algorithms](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com). It is one of those rare books which tackle theory and yet present the reader with working code. How I wish more books were written like this.

The book has its own [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jbrownlee/CleverAlgorithms), utilizing Ruby.

## Status

This is pretty much a **work-in-progress**. What I'm currently working on is verifying that the Ruby and the Python code listings encode the same algorithms. I may add new listings here and there but coming up with a framework to verify this is my main concern right now.

## File Organization

First of all, note that this repository isn't synchronized with [the main Clever Algorithms repository](https://github.com/jbrownlee/CleverAlgorithms). My main purpose is in learning the algorithms in the book and transcribing them to Python; I've come to believe that implementing algorithms on your own is a good learning exercise. I'm taking the Ruby listings as pseudocode that is also the reference implementation. In the process, I hope to familiarize myself with the algorithms and Ruby.

So, all directories, save for `python`, are not to be taken as updated.

Under the `python` directory, the code listings are sorted by chapter and are named after the name used by the book \(e.g., Random Search of Chapter 2 is `python/2_Stochastic_Algorithms/random_search.py`\). At the beginning of each file, I note the chapter and section in the book in which the algorithm can be found \(e.g., Random Search is noted as 2.2\). The docstring also contains a description the algorithm and some notes on the code listing itself. These were taken directly from the book, unless noted.

## Technical Specs

All Python codes will be for \(plain\) Python 3.

## Miscellaneous

There are [Python versions](http://code.google.com/p/aima-python/) of the pseudocodes in Russel and Norvig's _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_. There are also listings for other languages as well as a standard data set at the [book's official site](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/code.html).
